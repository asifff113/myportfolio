## 💡 Design Principles

1. **Consistency** - Same effects used across similar elements
2. **Hierarchy** - Important elements stand out
3. **Balance** - Not too overwhelming, not too plain
4. **Purpose** - Every animation serves a purpose
5. **Performance** - Beautiful but fast
6. **Accessibility** - Works for everyone
7. **Responsiveness** - Great on all screen sizes

---

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### CSS Variables Needed:
```css
:root {
  --primary-rgb: [R, G, B];
  --accent-rgb: [R, G, B];
  --secondary-rgb: [R, G, B];
}
```

### Framer Motion Variants:
- Entrance animations
- Stagger children
- Hover effects
- Exit animations

### Performance Optimizations:
- Use `will-change` sparingly
- Prefer `transform` and `opacity`
- Debounce scroll events
- Use `IntersectionObserver` for reveals
- Lazy load off-screen content
